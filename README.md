# Project Setup and Deployment Guide

Welcome to our project! This guide will walk you through the steps required to build the project, create a Docker image, and push the image to a repository. Following these instructions will ensure a smooth setup and deployment process.

## Building the Project

To compile the project and package it into a distributable format, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

This command executes the Gradle build script which compiles the source code, runs any tests, and packages the application.

## Creating a Docker Image

Once the project is built, you can containerize the application by creating a Docker image. From the root directory of the project, execute the following command:

```sh
docker build -t java-app .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image from the Dockerfile located in the current directory, and tag the resulting image with the name `java-app`.

## Pushing the Image to a Repository

After creating the Docker image, you may want to push it to a Docker repository for storage and distribution. First, tag your Docker image with the repository name and version:

```sh
docker tag java-app demo-app:java-1.0
```

This command tags the `java-app` image with the name `demo-app` and version `java-1.0`, preparing it for the push to a Docker repository.

### Best Practices

- **Comments and Documentation:** Ensure that your Dockerfile and any scripts used in the build process are well-commented. This helps others understand the purpose and functionality of each part of the build and deployment process.
- **Version Tagging:** Always tag your Docker images with specific versions rather than relying on the `latest` tag. This practice helps in maintaining consistency and traceability across different environments and deployments.
- **Automated Testing:** Incorporate automated testing in your build process to catch issues early. This ensures that only quality code is packaged and deployed.

By following these steps and best practices, you will have a solid foundation for building, containerizing, and deploying your application.
